This is <h3>SocietyPoisoner Trojan</h3> - Open Source Trojan for Android.
Don't use it in illegal cases (joke)
You can help me with it, by giving some money :)
What this trojan doing right now?:
1) Steal victim's SMS
2) Steal victim's contacts
3) Steal information about victim's android device:
  1) Info about sim-card:

         1) Phone Number

         2) Network operator name

  2) Android Version (release and codename)

  3) Device Model

  4) Current wifi hotspot name

Happy hunting ;)
